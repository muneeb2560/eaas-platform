Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp, and transaction data.","Blockchain is a digital ledger that stores data in connected blocks that can't be changed easily.","technology","hard"
"What is the water cycle?","The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below Earth's surface through evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection processes.","The water cycle is when water evaporates, forms clouds, rains, and goes back to rivers and oceans.","science","easy"
"Explain Newton's first law of motion","Newton's first law states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force. This is also known as the law of inertia.","Newton's first law says objects don't change their motion unless something pushes or pulls them.","physics","medium"
"What is democracy?","Democracy is a system of government where power is vested in the people, who rule either directly or through freely elected representatives. Key principles include majority rule, individual rights, and political equality.","Democracy is when people vote to choose their leaders and make decisions together.","politics","medium"
"How do vaccines work?","Vaccines work by introducing a weakened, killed, or modified version of a pathogen to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies and memory cells, providing immunity against future infections.","Vaccines teach your immune system to fight diseases by giving it a safe practice version.","medicine","medium"
"What is the Pythagorean theorem?","The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of squares of the other two sides: a² + b² = c².","The Pythagorean theorem is a² + b² = c² for right triangles.","mathematics","easy"
"Explain supply and demand","Supply and demand is an economic model describing the relationship between the availability of a commodity (supply) and the desire for that commodity (demand). When demand exceeds supply, prices tend to rise; when supply exceeds demand, prices tend to fall.","Supply and demand means when more people want something than available, prices go up.","economics","medium"
"What is machine learning?","Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed, using algorithms to identify patterns in data and make predictions.","Machine learning is when computers learn from data to make predictions without being programmed.","technology","medium"
"Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?","William Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet, a tragic play about young star-crossed lovers, first published in 1597.","Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet.","literature","easy"
"What is climate change?","Climate change refers to long-term shifts and alterations in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities that increase greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.","Climate change is when Earth's weather and temperature change over time because of pollution.","environment","medium"
"Explain DNA structure","DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) has a double helix structure consisting of two antiparallel strands of nucleotides connected by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs (A-T and G-C).","DNA is like a twisted ladder with bases that pair up: A with T, and G with C.","biology","hard"
"What is the theory of evolution?","The theory of evolution explains how species change over time through natural selection, where organisms with favorable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing these traits to offspring.","Evolution is how animals and plants change over time to survive better in their environment.","biology","medium"
"How does the internet work?","The internet works through a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols (TCP/IP) to transmit data packets across various networks, routers, and servers.","The internet connects computers around the world so they can share information.","technology","hard"
