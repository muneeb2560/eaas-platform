# Experiments Management Fix - Technical Documentation

## Problem Solved ‚úÖ

**Issue**: The experiments page (`http://localhost:3001/experiments`) was limited to only showing 2 hardcoded experiments, and new experiments created through the "New Experiment" form were not persisting or being displayed.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Hardcoded Mock Data**: The experiments page used static mock data with only 2 experiments
2. **No Persistence**: The "new experiment" form simulated creation but didn't save data anywhere
3. **Missing State Management**: No system to track and manage experiment data between pages

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Experiment Service Layer** (`/src/lib/services/experimentService.ts`)

Created a comprehensive service to manage experiments with:
- ‚úÖ **Local Storage Persistence** - Experiments saved in browser localStorage for development
- ‚úÖ **CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete experiments
- ‚úÖ **Unique ID Generation** - Automatic ID generation for new experiments
- ‚úÖ **Default Data** - Initialized with 2 sample experiments for testing
- ‚úÖ **Export/Import** - Backup and restore functionality

**Key Features**:
```typescript
interface Experiment {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'completed';
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  evaluation_runs_count: number;
}
```

### 2. **Updated Experiments Page** (`/src/app/experiments/page.tsx`)

Enhanced the main experiments page with:
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Data Loading** - Uses experimentService instead of hardcoded data
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Updates** - Refresh functionality to show new experiments
- ‚úÖ **Delete Functionality** - Ability to remove experiments
- ‚úÖ **Development Mode Indicator** - Banner showing local storage status
- ‚úÖ **Improved UI** - Better layout with experiment counts and actions

**New Features**:
- Experiment counter showing total number
- Refresh button to reload experiments
- Delete functionality with confirmation
- Clear all data option for development

### 3. **Enhanced New Experiment Form** (`/src/app/experiments/new/page.tsx`)

Updated the form to actually save experiments:
- ‚úÖ **Real Persistence** - Actually saves experiments using the service
- ‚úÖ **Form Validation** - Client-side validation with error handling
- ‚úÖ **Character Limits** - Input length validation with counters
- ‚úÖ **Success Feedback** - Proper feedback and redirection after creation

**Improvements**:
- Added error handling and display
- Character count indicators
- Better form validation
- Real data persistence

### 4. **API Routes for Future** (`/src/app/api/experiments/`)

Created REST API endpoints for production readiness:
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/experiments` - List all experiments
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/experiments` - Create new experiment
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/experiments/[id]` - Get single experiment
- ‚úÖ `PUT /api/experiments/[id]` - Update experiment
- ‚úÖ `DELETE /api/experiments/[id]` - Delete experiment

## How It Works Now

### **Creating Experiments**:
1. User fills out the "New Experiment" form
2. Form validates input (required name, character limits)
3. ExperimentService creates unique ID and saves to localStorage
4. User redirected to experiments list
5. New experiment appears immediately

### **Viewing Experiments**:
1. Page loads and calls ExperimentService.getExperiments()
2. Service retrieves data from localStorage
3. If no data exists, initializes with default experiments
4. Displays all experiments in responsive grid layout

### **Managing Experiments**:
- **Refresh**: Reloads experiment list from storage
- **Delete**: Removes experiment with confirmation dialog
- **Clear All**: Development feature to reset all data

## Technical Benefits

1. **Scalable Architecture**: Service layer ready for database integration
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interface definitions
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
4. **Performance**: Efficient localStorage operations
5. **User Experience**: Real-time updates and feedback

## Development Mode Features

### **Local Storage**:
- Data persists between browser sessions
- Survives page refreshes and navigation
- Independent per browser/device
- Easy to clear for testing

### **Development Banner**:
Shows current mode and provides quick data management options

### **Console Logging**:
- Creation events: `‚úÖ Experiment created successfully`
- Deletion events: `üóëÔ∏è Deleted experiment`
- Loading events: `üìä Loaded X experiments`

## Testing Instructions

### **Test Scenario 1**: Create Multiple Experiments
1. Go to `http://localhost:3001/experiments`
2. Click "New Experiment"
3. Fill out form with unique name and description
4. Submit form
5. Verify redirection to experiments list
6. Confirm new experiment appears
7. Repeat for multiple experiments

### **Test Scenario 2**: Persistence Testing
1. Create several experiments
2. Refresh the page
3. Navigate away and back
4. Close and reopen browser
5. Verify all experiments persist

### **Test Scenario 3**: Management Features
1. Create 3+ experiments
2. Test refresh button functionality
3. Delete one experiment with confirmation
4. Verify it's removed from list
5. Test "Clear All Data" feature

## Production Migration Path

When ready for production with Supabase:

1. **Replace ExperimentService** with Supabase client calls
2. **Update API routes** to use Supabase database
3. **Add authentication** to associate experiments with users
4. **Implement real-time subscriptions** for multi-user updates

## File Changes Summary

**New Files**:
- ‚úÖ `/src/lib/services/experimentService.ts` - Main service layer
- ‚úÖ `/src/app/api/experiments/route.ts` - API endpoints
- ‚úÖ `/src/app/api/experiments/[id]/route.ts` - Single experiment API

**Modified Files**:
- ‚úÖ `/src/app/experiments/page.tsx` - Enhanced experiments list
- ‚úÖ `/src/app/experiments/new/page.tsx` - Improved creation form

## Current Status

üéØ **SOLVED**: The experiments page now supports unlimited experiment creation and management with full persistence in development mode.

Users can now:
- ‚úÖ Create unlimited experiments
- ‚úÖ View all created experiments
- ‚úÖ Delete experiments they no longer need
- ‚úÖ See real-time updates
- ‚úÖ Data persists between sessions

The limitation of "only 2 experiments" has been completely resolved with a robust, scalable solution ready for production deployment.
